It follows the life of Tolani Ajao played by Niyola and her friend Rose played by Ijeoma Grace Agu. They are friends and roommates who work in the same bank. Roseâ€™s Boss Mr. Lamidi Salako is a very promiscuous man who abuses his power to harass his secretary. No one can stand up to him as he has the personnel department in his grip. He fires Rose because she refuses to be continuously harassed by him, and specifically asks for Tolani as a replacement.",
